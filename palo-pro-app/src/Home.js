                    <h2>About Me:</h2>
                    <p>My name is Juan Carlos Palomino. I also go by Junior. 21 year old Filmmaker and Developer. My hobbies
                <br />include movies, collecting music, foreign languages (I speak two: Spanish and Japanese), coding (I coded this website myself), and a good story.</p>
                    <p>My love for movies started at a very young age, watching Star Wars and other classics with my dad.
                <br />I started getting into video in high school and have been hooked ever since. I started Palomino Productions
                <br /> as an outlet for me to express my passion and to satisfy my creative drive. Part of that includes helping to tell other
                <br /> people’s stories and to eventually help them better remember a very important moment in life. Feel free to contact
                <br />me with any inquires, along with information on the event you want me to cover. I can’t wait to work with you! </p>
